* \mainpage Heavy Higgs project documentation
* This project aims on simulating \f$ t\bar{t} \f$ production in proton-proton collisions and in particular to take into account the effects of additional heavy, neutral Higgs bosons via s-channel exchange. This is relevant in the context of two-Higgs doublet models (MSSM) and more complicated extensions of the SM. The program comprises leading-order amplitudes as well as NLO corrections in the large \f$ m_t \f$ limit and is able to compute the total cross-section as well as arbitrary differential distributions.
