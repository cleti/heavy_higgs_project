This project aims on simulating $ t\bar{t} $ production in proton-\/proton collisions and in particular to take into account the effects of additional heavy, neutral Higgs bosons via s-\/channel exchange. This is relevant in the context of two-\/\-Higgs doublet models (M\-S\-S\-M) and more complicated extensions of the S\-M. The program comprises leading-\/order amplitudes as well as N\-L\-O corrections in the large $ m_t $ limit and is able to compute the total cross-\/section as well as arbitrary differential distributions.
