This program computes the process $ pp \rightarrow t\bar{t} $ taking into account the effects of additional heavy, neutral Higgs bosons in the s-\/channel at N\+L\+O Q\+C\+D. The N\+L\+O corrections for the squared Higgs production (resonant) amplitudes and the interference terms with the non-\/resonant background are computed in the large $ m_t $ limit. The N\+L\+O correction to the squared amplitudes corresponding to the S\+M only processes (the non-\/resonant background) are not computed within this program. The effects of heavy, neutral Higgs bosons are relevant for example in the context of two-\/\+Higgs doublet models (M\+S\+S\+M) and more complicated extensions of the S\+M Higgs sector. The program computes the total cross-\/section as well as arbitrary differential distributions.
