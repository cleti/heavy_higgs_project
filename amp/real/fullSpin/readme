IM_INTab : imaginary part of the interference terms of
	   scalar and pseudoscalar Phi-tt amplitudes (2IM[...])
	   (for a single Higgs boson!)
INT12    : full interference terms of two Higgs bosons Phi1 and Phi2
	   (2RE[...] !!!)
v2 	 : these are my own amplitudes, used to check the ones I copied
	   from WB's notes
